# U4_MU_Assessment
#### How Many Steps Completed:
###### I found it quite difficult to complete the majority of the steps. So, not many
#### Which Parts/Concepts Made Sense:
###### There was a lot of unfamiliarity with me, so I believe this would also tie in to the next question,
###### I had a difficult time trying to adhere to the time constraints while also attempting to execute the concepts in a formidable manner
###### How to properly access and use fragments, how to display data on them, implementing a recycler view in them
###### navigating through multiple classes and models and how the schema and architecture all tie in programmatically and otherwise
